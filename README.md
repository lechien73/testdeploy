# This is my first Markdown file

A paragraph is just a paragraph of text. You don't need to provide any p tags or breaks.

### Credits

Must mention @jordisutts for getting me out of a hole with JavaScript.

I used semantic `<section>` tags instead of `<div>`

```javascript
function multiplication(a,b) {
   if(typeof(a) == "number" && typeof(b) == "number") {
       return a * b;
   } else {
       alert("Error!");
   }
}
```

## This is a subheading

```html
<a href="cheese">test</a>
```

Under here is really interesting information in English or another language that is not fake Latin.

### This will be rendered as a h3

If you want text to be italic, then *this will be italic text*

If you want text to be bold, then **this will be bold text**

**_this should be bold italic_**

### Links and lists

If you want to create a link, then [here is a link to Google](https://www.google.com)

* This is an unordered list item
* So is this
* And this

1. This is an ordered list
2. This will be numbered
3. So will this
    3. This is a subpoint
    4. As is this.

1. This is an ordered list
1. So is this
1. This is numbered item 3
   1. This is a subpoint
   1. This is too.
